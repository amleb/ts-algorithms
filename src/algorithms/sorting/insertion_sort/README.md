# Insertion Sort

The array is virtually split into two subarrays: sorted and unsorted.
At each iteration, insertion sort takes one element from the unsorted part and puts it in the right location in the sorted list.

# Recursive Insertion Sort
Same as the Insertion Sort but with recursive approach instead of iteration over all the elements.

Time complexity: O(N<sup>2</sup>)
