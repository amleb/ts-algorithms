# Counting Sort

A non-comparison-based sorting algorithm where the idea is to count the frequency of each distinct element
in the input array and use that information to place the elements in their correct positions in the output array.

Time Complexity: O(N+M), where N and M are the size of input and counting arrays respectively. 

Auxiliary space: O(N+M), where N and M are the size of output and counting arrays respectively.
